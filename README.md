## Student project for [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/)

This page let you create your own collection of the most beautiful places in Russia. Create your mood board, adding pictures of the favorite places. And dont forget to fill in profile name and job to identify yourself.
This student project is made with HTML, CSS and JS codes using BEM methodology. Here i first time used js code to make popup open and close. I also used form to get an opportunity to change profile information.
The code is bundled with Webpack.
